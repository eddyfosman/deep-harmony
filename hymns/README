There were many duplicate (or near-duplicate) copies of hymns -- recordings from
different hymnals.  These caused some hymns to have more effect in training. I 
think the smaller hymndata directory has about 2000 unique hymns, with one chosen 
at random from each collection with the same incipit. 

The test4.sop file has the test melodies to generate harmonies for. These hymns
have hopefully been removed from the hymndata training data. 

Note also that many of the midi files were recordings of human performances and that
the incipit code does not work well for such files. I believe these have been 
removed. 

This data isn't really very clean yet; should maybe redo to make sure we have 
clean midi files with one instance of each unique hymn.
