Major tasks:

  mut import/export subconverter 
    - finish importer for music tokens format 
      - add rests with chords
      - handle <bar> indicating pickup measures: make a first pass, count pickup beats, 
        and add an appropriate number of rests before importing music. Delete the intro 
        rests at the end.
    - convert to_mut function to a subconverter
      - rewrite music2mut to use subconverter
      - output metadata into mut files

  machine learning mechanics
    - install a nmt system, get it working
    - a script convert a collection of music files to training data
    - a script to generate a container with a training task that can be run on various 
      computers

  training data preparation
    - make clean directories of training data for bach, hymns
    - find training data for additional styles, e.g. jazz, contemporary, ??

  machine learing modifications
    - use 28-bit representation (pitch class, octave, duration) for notes instead of
      700+-bit one-hot 
    - generate more than one translation (haromonization) stochastically
    - use ML to generate guitar chords
    - from melody generate chords, then from melody + chords generate bass line, then
      from all of those generate tenor line, etc. 
    - learn to determine beat strength from music, text. Better selection of new tunes 
      for texts. 

  utilities
    - make sure incipit.py works on test-mut files
